                    <p>The Super Advanced Robot Arm, or SARA, was a personal project of mine designed to apply 
                        knowledge learned during my education to work on something that was fun and interesting
                        for me. SARA was designed and maufactured by me using solidworks and my personal 3D printer.
                        SARA's design inspiration was taken from different sources of professional robot arms
                        and simplified for ease of maintenece and manufacturing, while leaving lots of room for
                        modification and improvements. The end-effector of the robot was designed to hold a marker,
                        allowing the robot to be controlled or automated to draw on a page. SARA uses servo motors
                        along with an arduino microcontroller and membrane switch for manual control. A full inverse
                        displacement solution was developed to allow the robot to be automated for certain tasks.
                        Current iterations and improvements are still being made to this projects.

                    <p>The Electrical Power Conversion Unit was my capstone project as a part of my final year of my 
                        undergraduate degree. The purpose of this project was to create a way for clean, off-grid 
                        energy to be produced at any rotational speed. Using a continuously variable transmission,
                        or CVT, and connecting it to an induction machine, a device was created to convert 
                        rotational mechanical energy into electrical power no matter what the rotational speed was.
                        The induction machine produced 120V AC at a specific speed, and the transmission was modified
                        to automatically gear the generator down if the speed would cause the voltage to go above 
                        what is safe for the device.

                    <p>One of the school projects that I worked on during my education was a small mobile robot designed to 
                        solve a maze of a known layout. The robot was assembled using parts designed by our group and 
                        manufactured on my personal 3D printer. The electronics for the robot were provided by the school,
                        and consisted of an arduino microcontroller, 2 DC motors, and a few distance sensors. The algorithm 
                        for the robot included a PID that controlled the voltage given to each of the wheels, to correct any 
                        drift from left to right sensed by the distance sensors.

                    <p>This project involved using ROS to get a tutlebot wafflepi to complete different
                        milestones that build off of each other. The milestones involved mapping a room of 
                        approximately 15 square meters, detecting and avoiding packages, and retrieving these
                        packages and returning them to the start point. The mapping and localization was document
                        with a lidar sensor mounted on the top of the robot. The detection of the packages was done 
                        with the help of a camera and a custom developed search algorithm. Package retrieval was 
                        accomplished using custom 3D printed parts to grab the package and return to the start point.
